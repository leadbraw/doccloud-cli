# DocCloud Tool

A simple CLI tool to enable interacting with DocumentCloud from the comfort of the terminal. Uses the [python-documentcloud](https://github.com/muckrock/python-documentcloud) wrapper of the DocumentCloud API.

## Features ##
- Logging into DocumentCloud
- Searching for documents (with hyperlinking!)
- Uploading documents
- Viewing/saving the full text of documents as parsed by DocumentCloud (your mileage may vary)

## TODO (last updated Feb 16 2025) ##
- Improve uploading functionality (uploading from URL)
- Support for viewing/adding/deleting annotations
- Improve search functionality (ability to fetch more metadata)
